\title{Manually update the session id link between the postable and the rest of the tables}
\usage{
updatePosdataSession()
}
\description{
This runs a function that manually updates the session ids in the positions.postable. Earlier this was done automatically after all
inserts or updates to postable, but this was time consuming, possibly because it triggered the update many times. Now the sessions needs
to be updated manually, for example by using this function. Beware that it takes more than 30 minutes to complete.
