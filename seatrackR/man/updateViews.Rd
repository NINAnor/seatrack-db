\title{Manually update the the materialized views of database stats}
\usage{
updateViews()
}
\description{
This runs a function that manually updates the materialized views in the schema "views". Earlier this was done automatically after all
inserts or updates to postable, but this was time consuming, possibly because it triggered the update many times. Now the needs
to be updated manually, for example by using this function. Beware that it takes a couple of minutes to complete.
